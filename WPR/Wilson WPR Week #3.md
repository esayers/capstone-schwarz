Name: Ben Wilson <br>
WW:	December 27, 2014 - January 2, 2015 <br>

## Plan:
I plan on reading more material on the subject of DSP, software defined radios (SDR), and looking into ways to simulate our first attempts at DSP. I still need to contact Vernon to ask what the actual deliverables will be on January 6th.

## Actual Progress:
I spent another 4 hours this reading up on DSP and software defined radios. I downloaded a free program called SDR# to play with some DSP tools. I ordered a digital TV receiver that can be hacked to make an SDR that can see signals in the same spectral range as a GPS receiver.

## Plan for the upcoming week:
* Create a list of strengths and weakness to give to Vernon. <br>
* Meet with industry sponsor to present the research from the past month. <br> 
* Start thinking about/researching ways to simulate our project in MatLab. <br>
* Research I/Q modulation. <br>

## Miscellaneous Information:
I purchased an RTL-SDR dongle from Amazon and I will be playing with that this week along with the SDR#.
