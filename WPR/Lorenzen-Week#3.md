##	Plan
  This week’s plan is to continue reading information from the gathered sources and meet with the group to start on the presentation.
##  Actual Progress
This week I finished reading selected resource documents and am currently in communication with the group trying to find a meeting time to begin the presentation. Current meeting time is set for Saturday at 14:00. Project will remain on schedule.
##	Plan for the upcoming week
  Next week I would like to start a design requirements document, know group strengths and weaknesses to adjust gant chart accordingly, start researching possible solution implementations and FPGAs.
