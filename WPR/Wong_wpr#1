1.	Plan:  During this period and till now, I was searching information on internet about GPS jamming methods.
2.	Actual Progress:  I was reading articles and sorting out the information of my findings.  One of most interesting article from SENTINEL research project is about the threat of GPS jamming.  I read through the first few chapters.  Hope would get some good ideas from this article and others of my findings.
3.	Plan for the upcoming week:  I will continue reading of my findings and doing more research about GPS jamming on internet or at library.
