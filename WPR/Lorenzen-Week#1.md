##	Plan
  this week’s plan was to gather information from various sources on methods of GPS jamming.
##  Actual Progress
This week I gathered 22 sources on GPS jamming methods and six sources on direction of arrival methods. Currently I am on
track with the courant project timeline and will be ready to collaborate with the team to create a consolidated overview of our
findings. In addition updates and additions related to project information have been added to GitHub and the wiki a project
specifications document has been started as well as a draft of the project schedule. These items are ready for review and may
allow the project schedule to be moved up by a week. <br>
##	Plan for the upcoming week
  For the next week I plan on continuing to read through the resources and start written overview of my findings.
