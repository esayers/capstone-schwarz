Name:  	Ben Wilson
WW: 	Dec. 20 â€“ Dec. 26, 2014

1.	Plan:  
I planned on finding out what the deliverables will be for our Jan 6th meeting to present our initial findings. I will continue reading about software defined radios, GPS receivers, and methods of signal processing. I would also like to do a little bit of research on the FPGA board we will be using and its specs.
2.	Actual Progress:  
I spent around 4 hours this week reading chapter 15 of the 2013 ARRL Handbook (DSP and Software Defined Radios).
3.	Plan for the upcoming week:  
I plan on reading more material on the subject of DSP, software defined radios (SDR), and looking into ways to simulate our first attempts at DSP. I still need to contact Vernon to ask what the actual deliverables will be on January 6th.
4.	Miscellaneous Information:  
I took some time off last week for Christmas and therefore spent less than the usual amount of time on the project.
